# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat deploy-zksync
npx hardhat verify --network zkTestnet 0x0BbDeDF09E62c2fBf8c16e972fE73
